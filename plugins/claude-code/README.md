# SpecStream for Claude

Ask for any list in plain words and get every match from the live web: companies, places, people, job posts, repositories, datasets. Each row comes with the page it was read from.

## What it adds

- **The SpecStream MCP server** at `https://api.specstream.ai/mcp`. The first time you use it, Claude asks you to sign in to SpecStream in your browser (OAuth). No API key is stored in the plugin.
- **Four skills**: `compile` reads your request and shows how SpecStream understood it, `review-work` gets the price, `approve-work` starts the list after you say yes to that price, and `continue-work` brings back more rows, refreshes a list or adds details.

## What it sends

Your request and your answers to the price go to SpecStream's API over HTTPS. Results come back from the same API. Nothing else is read from your machine, and nothing runs locally.

## Price

Reading a request and getting a price are free. A list runs only after you approve its maximum price, and you pay only for matching rows, from 10 cents each. New accounts get $10 of work free.
