# opencode-specstream

SpecStream plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). SpecStream is the live web data engine for teams and agents: describe a list in plain words ("roofing companies in Columbus, Ohio with their website and phone") and get every matching row, each with the page it came from. You see the price first, you approve a ceiling, and you pay per match. A search that finds nothing costs nothing.

The plugin does two things when OpenCode starts:

- adds the hosted SpecStream MCP server, `https://api.specstream.ai/mcp`, to your config as `specstream`
- adds four agent skills: `compile` (read the request back), `review-work` (get the price), `approve-work` (approve it) and `continue-work` (read the rows, send them on, keep them current)

## Install

OpenCode 1.18.29 or newer, and OpenCode 2:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-specstream"]
}
```

In OpenCode 2 the key is `plugins`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": ["opencode-specstream"]
}
```

OpenCode installs the package on the next launch.

## Sign in

The server uses OAuth, so you do not paste a key. Run:

```sh
opencode mcp auth specstream
```

Your browser opens, you sign in to SpecStream, and OpenCode keeps the token. New accounts start with $10 of work free for 30 days, no card.

To use an API key instead, for example on a machine with no browser, create one under **Agents & API** in the [workspace](https://specstream.ai/workspace) and set it where OpenCode starts:

```sh
export SPECSTREAM_API_KEY="ss_live_..."
```

With the variable set, the plugin sends it as a bearer header and turns the browser sign-in off. Give the key only what the task needs: its scope, projects, an expiry and a spending limit.

## Use it

Ask for a list:

> Find food banks in Texas, with their annual revenue.

The agent reads the request back, shows the quoted ceiling, and starts only after you say yes. Rows come back with their source pages, ready to export as CSV, Excel or JSON or to send to Google Sheets, Notion, Airtable, HubSpot or Salesforce.

## Options

Both parts are on by default. Turn either off with plugin options:

```json
{
  "plugin": [["opencode-specstream", { "skills": false }]]
}
```

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mcp` | `true` | `false` leaves the MCP server out |
| `skills` | `true` | `false` leaves the four skills out |

A `specstream` entry you already wrote under `mcp` is never replaced.

## Develop

```sh
npm ci
npm run check   # tsc --noEmit
npm test
```

The skills in `skills/` are copies of the repository's [`skills/`](../../skills); a test fails when they drift. The package ships its TypeScript source, as OpenCode runs plugins directly.
