# SpecStream for Convex

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@specstream/convex.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@specstream/convex)

Ask for a list in plain words and get the whole thing in your Convex database: every matching row, each with the page it was read from, arriving while your UI watches. A search tool hands your app ten pages to read. [SpecStream](https://specstream.ai) hands it the finished list.

```ts
const specstream = new SpecStreamClient(components.specstream);

// One call. The price is capped by your code, and nothing runs above the cap.
const result = await specstream.findList(ctx, {
  request: "food banks in Texas, with their annual revenue",
  rows: 100,
  maxPriceUsd: 15,
  onComplete: internal.lists.onFinished,
});

// Rows land in your tables as SpecStream finds them.
const page = await specstream.listRows(ctx, {
  listId: result.listId,
  paginationOpts: { numItems: 50, cursor: null },
});
```

[SpecStream](https://specstream.ai) is the live web data engine for teams and agents. You pay only for the matches, and a search that finds nothing costs nothing. A free account starts with $10 of work to use within 30 days and needs no card.

## What you get

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `findList` | Read a request, price it, and start it only when the most it can cost is within your maximum |
| `quote` and `approve` | The same in two steps: show the person the price, then approve exactly that price |
| `getList` and `listRows` | Status, a live row count and the rows, as plain Convex queries your client subscribes to |
| Every row's page | Each cell carries the page it came from and when SpecStream read it. `row.sourceUrl` is the page behind the row |
| `onComplete` | Your mutation runs once when the list finishes, with whatever context you passed |
| Webhook route | Optional. SpecStream calls your deployment when a list finishes, so it shows up without waiting for a status check |
| `cancel`, `resume`, `deleteList` | Stop a list and keep the rows found so far, pick tracking back up, clean up |

Lists take minutes, so they outlive any single action. The component owns the `quotes`, `lists` and `rows` tables, follows each list until it is done, and exposes plain queries. Your UI subscribes to a list the way it subscribes to anything else in Convex.

## Install

```sh
npm install @specstream/convex
```

Add the component to your app and wire the API key through typed component env:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";
import specstream from "@specstream/convex/convex.config";

const app = defineApp({
  env: {
    SPECSTREAM_API_KEY: v.string(),
    SPECSTREAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET: v.optional(v.string()),
  },
});

app.use(specstream, {
  // Mounts the webhook route at <your-site>/specstream/webhook. Optional.
  httpPrefix: "/specstream/",
  env: {
    SPECSTREAM_API_KEY: app.env.SPECSTREAM_API_KEY,
    SPECSTREAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET: app.env.SPECSTREAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
  },
});

export default app;
```

Create a key under **Agents & API** in your [SpecStream workspace](https://specstream.ai/workspace/agents), then set it on your deployment:

```sh
npx convex env set SPECSTREAM_API_KEY ss_live_your_key
npx convex dev
```

Give the key a spending limit in the workspace too. It stacks with the cap in your code.

## Find a list

Call the component from your own actions. Authentication, authorization and rate limiting belong in your app: components can't see `ctx.auth`. The [example app](example/convex/example.ts) shows the full pattern, with a `requireUser` gate on every spending endpoint and an app-owned list to user table checked before any list can be read, canceled or deleted.

```ts
// convex/lists.ts
import { v } from "convex/values";
import { SpecStreamClient } from "@specstream/convex";
import { action } from "./_generated/server";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

const specstream = new SpecStreamClient(components.specstream);

export const findFoodBanks = action({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const result = await specstream.findList(ctx, {
      request: "food banks in Texas, with their annual revenue",
      rows: 100,
      maxPriceUsd: 15,
    });
    if (result.status === "needs_edit") return result.message; // add the place, or what every row must meet
    if (result.status === "over_maximum") return result.message; // nothing ran
    return result.listId; // subscribe to this
  },
});
```

`findList` returns one of three things:

- `started`: the list is running. `listId` is its id in your database, `link` opens it in the SpecStream workspace.
- `needs_edit`: SpecStream couldn't price the request as written. `readAs` is what it understood, so you can show what was missing. Nothing ran.
- `over_maximum`: the most the list can cost is above `maxPriceUsd`. Nothing ran.

Your request can name its own row count ("50 roofers in Columbus rated 4.5 or better"). `rows` is the count you are pricing for, from 1 to 1000.

### Show the price first

When a person should see the price before anything runs, use the two steps. `quote` reads the request and prices it. `approve` starts the list, and `confirmMaxCents` has to equal the quote's own maximum, so the amount approved is always the amount shown.

```ts
const quote = await specstream.quote(ctx, {
  request: "dentists in Lisbon that take new patients",
  rows: 50,
});
if (quote.status === "quoted") {
  // Show quote.maximumCents, then, when the person says yes:
  await specstream.approve(ctx, {
    quoteId: quote.quoteId,
    confirmMaxCents: quote.maximumCents,
    idempotencyKey: `${userId}-${quote.quoteId}`, // a double click starts one list
  });
}
```

The maximum is a ceiling. You pay only for rows that match. Approving the same quote twice starts one list, and an expired quote runs nothing.

## Read the rows

```ts
// convex/lists.ts
export const rows = query({
  args: { listId: v.string(), paginationOpts: paginationOptsValidator },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Check that the caller owns this list first.
    return await specstream.listRows(ctx, args);
  },
});
```

```tsx
// React
const { results, status, loadMore } = usePaginatedQuery(
  api.lists.rows,
  { listId },
  { initialNumItems: 50 },
);
```

The count climbs as rows arrive. Each row looks like this:

```ts
{
  entityId: "...",            // SpecStream's id for the thing the row describes
  ordinal: 26,
  sourceUrl: "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2052031/000205203126000006/primary_doc.xml",
  observedAt: "2026-10-14T19:56:02.016693Z",
  cells: [
    { columnId: "organization", label: "Organization", display: "RapidCanvas Inc", sourceUrl: "https://www.sec.gov/...", observedAt: "..." },
    { columnId: "amount_sold", label: "Amount sold (USD)", display: "28999988", sourceUrl: "https://www.sec.gov/...", observedAt: "..." },
  ],
}
```

A fact a source doesn't publish has an empty `display` and an `absence` such as "Not published". It is never guessed. `flattenRow(row)` gives one field per column label, ready for a table or a prompt:

```ts
import { flattenRow } from "@specstream/convex";

flattenRow(row);
// { entityId, position: 26, Organization: "RapidCanvas Inc", "Amount sold (USD)": "28999988",
//   sourceUrl: "https://www.sec.gov/...", checkedAt: "2026-10-14T19:56:02Z" }
```

Other reads: `getList` (status and progress), `listLists`, `getRow`, `getListBySpecstreamId` and `getQuote`.

## When a list finishes

Pass an `onComplete` mutation and it runs once when the list reaches a final state: `completed`, `partial` (SpecStream finished with the rows it found, fewer than you asked for), `failed`, `canceled` or `expired`.

```ts
import type { ListCompletePayload } from "@specstream/convex";

export const onFinished = internalMutation({
  args: {
    listId: v.string(),
    specstreamListId: v.string(),
    status: v.string(),
    rowCount: v.number(),
    requestedCount: v.number(),
    error: v.optional(v.string()),
    context: v.optional(v.any()),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Mail the person, enrich the rows, mark the report ready.
  },
});
```

Whatever you passed as `context` comes back untouched.

## Webhook mode

By default the component checks each list every few seconds, backing off to fifteen. If you mount the HTTP route, SpecStream tells your deployment the moment a list finishes, and the component checks only slowly as a safety net. Webhooks belong to your SpecStream account, so register one once:

```ts
// npx convex run example:registerWebhook '{"siteUrl":"https://your-name.convex.site"}'
const { hookId, secret } = await specstream.registerWebhook(
  ctx,
  "https://your-name.convex.site/specstream/webhook",
);
```

```sh
npx convex env set SPECSTREAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET <the secret it returned>
```

Pass `mode: "webhook"` to `findList` or `approve` for lists you expect the webhook to finish. With the secret set, every delivery must carry a valid `Specstream-Signature` (signed over `<timestamp>.<body>`, refused after five minutes). Either way a delivery only wakes a list the component already tracks: rows always come from the SpecStream API with your key, never from the delivery.

SpecStream delivers webhooks only to public `https://` addresses on port 443, so a deployment on localhost uses the default checks.

## Use it for

- **Prospect lists inside your own app.** A sales tool where a rep types "roofers in Columbus rated 4.5 or better, with a phone number" and watches rows fill in, each linked to its page.
- **An agent that finds lists.** Wrap `findList` in a tool for your Convex agent. It picks the request and the row count, and your code owns the maximum.
- **A directory that fills itself.** Start a list per city or category from a scheduled function, store the rows, and render them from your own tables.
- **Market maps and research dashboards.** "US startups that filed a $5M+ Form D this week", with the filing behind every row, ready for a table or a chart.

## Good to know

- **The component never spends on its own.** Every list starts from a quote, and the amount you approve must equal the quote's maximum. A mismatch, an expired quote or an account SpecStream can't authorize runs nothing.
- **Your app owns who may do what.** The component doesn't know about users. Keep an owner table like the example's and check it on every list-scoped call.
- **Errors are `ConvexError`s** with `data: { code, message, status? }`. Codes the component raises: `specstream_missing_api_key`, `specstream_empty_request`, `specstream_bad_rows`, `specstream_bad_maximum`, `specstream_unknown_quote`, `specstream_quote_expired`, `specstream_quote_not_approvable`, `specstream_approval_mismatch`, `specstream_bad_idempotency_key` and `specstream_request_failed`. SpecStream's own error codes arrive as `specstream_<code>`. A rate limit or a server error is retried three times first.
- **Tracking can stop.** After a key stops working, or after 400 status checks, the list is marked `failed` with a message starting "Stopped tracking this list". The list may still be running at SpecStream. Fix the key and call `resume`.
- **Convex's 1MB document limit.** Rows are small. A row that would exceed the limit loses its full detail set first, then its raw values, and keeps its displayed text and its page.
- **Reading is free.** `refresh` reads the latest status and rows now. Re-reading a list never duplicates rows.
- **Another base URL.** Set `SPECSTREAM_API_URL` to point the component at a different host, such as the mock in the example.

## Testing

Register the component with [`convex-test`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convex-test), then stub `fetch` for `api.specstream.ai`:

```ts
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import specstream from "@specstream/convex/test";
import schema from "./schema";

const t = convexTest(schema, import.meta.glob("./**/*.*s"));
specstream.register(t);
```

The example app's [`setup.test.ts`](example/convex/setup.test.ts) and [`example.test.ts`](example/convex/example.test.ts) show a full run: quote, approve, rows, the completion callback, and one person unable to read another's list.

## Try it locally

[`example/mock-specstream.mjs`](example/mock-specstream.mjs) implements the calls the component makes and fills a list in at one row a second, so you can watch rows arrive without spending anything. From this folder:

```sh
npm install

# terminal 1: the stand-in for SpecStream
SPECSTREAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec-mock npm run dev:mock

# terminal 2: point the component at it, then start Convex
npx convex env set SPECSTREAM_API_KEY ss_mock_key
npx convex env set SPECSTREAM_API_URL http://127.0.0.1:4343
# The CLI calls functions without signing in. This lets the walkthrough run.
# Local deployments only: never set it on anything reachable from the internet.
npx convex env set DEMO_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS true
npm run dev
```

Then, from a third terminal:

```sh
npx convex run example:quoteList '{"request":"food banks in Texas","rows":10}'
npx convex run example:approveList '{"quoteId":"<quoteId from above>","confirmMaxCents":150}'
npx convex run example:myLists
```

To use the real service, remove `SPECSTREAM_API_URL` and set a real key. See the [example README](example/README.md).

## FAQ

**What does a list cost?** The quote shows the maximum before anything runs. You pay only for rows that match, and a search that finds nothing costs nothing. Rates are on the [pricing page](https://specstream.ai/pricing).

**Can the model or the browser raise the price?** No. The maximum is an argument in your server code. `confirmMaxCents` has to match the quote the component saved.

**What if my deployment restarts mid-list?** The list keeps running at SpecStream and the component's scheduled checks continue from the database. Rows already stored stay stored.

**Where do I see the list outside Convex?** Every list has a `link` that opens it in your SpecStream workspace, where it can be sent to Sheets or a CRM.

**Which requests work?** Anything you can say in a sentence that has a place or a condition every row must meet: "dentists in Lisbon that take new patients". A request that is too loose comes back as `needs_edit` with what SpecStream read.

## Development

```sh
npm install        # npm 11 resolves this repo's peer graph; npm 10 may stop with an arborist error
npm run build      # compile to dist/
npm test           # vitest, including the example app
npm run typecheck  # the component, the example, and the example's Convex functions
npm run lint
```

The files under `_generated/` are committed, the way Convex components publish them. After changing a function's arguments or return value, run `npx convex dev` once against a deployment to regenerate them, or edit `src/component/_generated/component.ts` by hand to match.
