# @specstream/openclaw-plugin

Ask your OpenClaw agent for a list and get the whole list back. "Dental clinics in Lisbon with online booking, with their website and phone." Every row comes from the live web with the page it was read from, so you can open it and look. You pay per match, and a search that finds nothing costs nothing.

[SpecStream](https://specstream.ai) is the live web data engine for teams and agents. This plugin gives OpenClaw two tools for it and, if you want the full conversation with SpecStream, four skills.

## Install

From ClawHub:

```sh
openclaw plugins install clawhub:@specstream/openclaw-plugin
```

Or from npm:

```sh
openclaw plugins install @specstream/openclaw-plugin
```

Needs OpenClaw 2026.10.3 or newer.

## Set it up

Create an API key under **Agents & API** in your [SpecStream workspace](https://specstream.ai/workspace). New accounts start with $10 of work free for 30 days, no card.

The plugin reads the key from `SPECSTREAM_API_KEY`. To keep it in your OpenClaw config instead, store a SecretRef that points at the variable:

```sh
openclaw config set plugins.entries.specstream.config.apiKey \
  '{"source":"env","provider":"default","id":"SPECSTREAM_API_KEY"}' --strict-json
```

Then set the most one list may cost. This is the number that lets you hand the agent a tool that spends money:

```sh
openclaw config set plugins.entries.specstream.config.maxPriceUsd 5
```

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiKey` | `SPECSTREAM_API_KEY` | Your SpecStream API key, or a SecretRef |
| `maxPriceUsd` | `5` | The price ceiling for one list, in US dollars |
| `waitSeconds` | `300` | How long a find waits for a running list before it returns the rows so far |

Give the key only what the task needs: its scope, projects, an expiry and a spending limit.

## The tools

### `specstream_find_list`

| Input | |
| --- | --- |
| `request` | The list in plain words: what to find, where, what every row must meet, and the facts to bring back |
| `max_results` | How many rows, 1 to 1000. Default 25 |
| `max_price_usd` | Optional. A lower ceiling for this call |

The tool reads the request, gets the price, and starts the run only if the quoted maximum is within your ceiling. The agent can ask for a lower ceiling on a call and can never raise yours. If the price is above the ceiling, nothing runs and the agent is told so. Results cost 10 cents, 30 cents or $1 each depending on the list, plus 10 cents for a person's email and 25 cents for a phone number, and nothing when nothing matches.

It waits for the list, then returns JSON: `state`, `list_id`, `list_link` and `rows`. Each row has its columns plus `source_url` and `checked_at`. A retry of the same request with the same limits within the hour reaches the run it already started, so a flaky turn does not buy the list twice.

### `specstream_get_list_rows`

Reads every row of a list you already own, by `list_id`. Free. Use it when a big list was still running at the end of the wait.

## Skills and the SpecStream server (optional)

The plugin ships four skills: `specstream-compile` (read the request back), `specstream-review-work` (get the price), `specstream-approve-work` (approve it) and `specstream-continue-work` (read the rows, send them to Sheets, Notion, HubSpot and more, keep them current). They use the hosted SpecStream server and stay hidden until you add it:

```sh
openclaw mcp set specstream '{"url":"https://api.specstream.ai/mcp","transport":"streamable-http","auth":"oauth"}'
openclaw mcp login specstream
```

The tools above work without it.

## Example

> Find food banks in Texas with their annual revenue. Keep it under $3.

The agent calls `specstream_find_list` with `max_price_usd: 3`, and you get a table of food banks, each row with the page it came from, plus a link to open the list in your workspace.

## Develop

```sh
npm ci
npm run check            # tsc, source and tests
npm test                 # vitest, fetch mocked
npm run plugin:validate  # OpenClaw's own manifest validator
```
