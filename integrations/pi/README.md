# SpecStream for Pi

Ask for any list in plain words and get every match from the live web, each row with the page it was read from: lead lists, company lists, grants, jobs, places. You see the price before anything runs and pay only for the matching rows, from 10 cents each.

This is a [Pi package](https://pi.dev/packages). It adds the hosted [SpecStream](https://specstream.ai) MCP server and four skills, so Pi reads your request back, gets the price, asks you to approve it, and returns the finished list.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@specstream/pi-package
pi mcp login specstream
```

The second command opens SpecStream in your browser. Sign in and approve access; Pi stores the token and refreshes it. New accounts get $10 of work free for 30 days. Inside a session, `/mcp` shows the connection and lets you sign in or out.

Try it for one run without installing: `pi -e npm:@specstream/pi-package`.

## What you get

- **The SpecStream MCP server** at `https://api.specstream.ai/mcp`, registered by a small extension (`extensions/specstream.ts`). It uses Pi's built-in MCP support, OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration, and no stored credentials. Five tools stay in view (`compile`, `quote_capacity_work`, `authorize_capacity_work`, `get_find`, `list_find_rows`); the rest load on demand through `tool_search`. In Pi they are named `mcp__specstream__<tool>`.
- **Four skills**, loaded when the task calls for them or by name:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/skill:specstream-compile` | Reads your request back before anything runs |
| `/skill:specstream-review-work` | Gets the exact price and its expiry |
| `/skill:specstream-approve-work` | Starts the list after you approve that price |
| `/skill:specstream-continue-work` | Reads every row, sends them to Sheets, Excel, Notion, Airtable, HubSpot or Salesforce, brings back more, refreshes, monitors |

## Try it

```text
Find every independent bookstore in Oregon with a website and a phone number.
```

```text
List open grants for food banks in Texas, with the deadline and the award size.
```

Reading a request and getting its price are free. Nothing that costs money runs until you approve an exact maximum.

## Use an API key instead (servers, CI)

Create a key under **Agents & API** in the [workspace](https://specstream.ai/workspace), give it only what the task needs (read, prepare or execute), its projects, an expiry and a spending limit, then export it before starting Pi:

```bash
export SPECSTREAM_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

When the variable is set, the extension sends it as `Authorization: Bearer ${SPECSTREAM_API_KEY}`. Pi fills the value in from your environment, so the key is never written to a file by this package.

## Only the MCP server, no package

```bash
pi mcp add specstream --url https://api.specstream.ai/mcp
pi mcp login specstream
```

That adds the server to `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` and skips the skills. A server of the same name in `mcp.json` takes precedence over the one this package registers.

## What it sends

Your request and your answers to the price go to `api.specstream.ai` over HTTPS, and results come back from the same API. The extension reads one environment variable, `SPECSTREAM_API_KEY`, and only to decide whether to add the header. It reads no files, runs no commands and installs no dependencies.

## Price

A list runs only after you approve its maximum price. Results cost 10 cents, 30 cents or $1 each depending on the kind of work, plus 10 cents for a person's email and 25 cents for a phone. Nothing is charged when nothing matches, and possible matches that were not confirmed are never billed. [Pricing](https://specstream.ai/pricing)
